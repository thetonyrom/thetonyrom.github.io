#### Hi, my name is Tony and I am a seasoned Software Engineer.

## /in_brief

I started working in a large outsourcing company, then worked remotely in several product companies and startups,
following the best practices and agile methodologies.
Even though my primary focus has become a backend, infrastructure, and security I am interested in React and Vue.

I have a master's degree in applied mathematics and computer science and 7+ years of experience in web development.
Significant professional experience with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

I have been published in scientific journals and one of my major achievements is that
I brought mathematical novelty and defended my thesis on DNA sequencing using nanopores.

I am fond of chess, powerlifting, Russian pyramid, but programming is my passion.

If you are interested in cooperation, please email me, <a href="mailto:thetonyrom@gmail.com">thetonyrom@gmail.com</a>.
