>And remember, VIM is a process.

Hi there! My name is Tony and I am going to show you the way how to conquer VIM in a week!

## Installation

If you don't have it installed yet.

### OSX

In case you haven't heard about **homebrew** follow the [link][homebrew]{:target="blank"}.

{% highlight bash %}
  $ brew install vim
{% endhighlight %}

### \*nix
*Just use your favorite package manager;*

Well, we are fully equipped and ready to go! To start Vim just type in your terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
  $ vim
{% endhighlight %}

## The most common question
It is funny, but a lot of people don't know [how to exit the Vim editor][exit_vim]{:target="blank"}. There is even a book!

Ok, I'm kidding:)
