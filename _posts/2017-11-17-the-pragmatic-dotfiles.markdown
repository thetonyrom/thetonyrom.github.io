Hi there! My name is Tony and I am going to show you the pragmatic way to manage *dotfiles*.

Unix command-line tools can be configured using plain-text hidden files, commonly known as *dotfiles*.
They are called "dotfiles" as they typically are named with a leading `.` making them hidden files on your system.
Since these files are all plain text, we can gather them together in a git repository and use that to track the changes you make over time.
